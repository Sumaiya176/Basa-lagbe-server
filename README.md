# 🏠 Basa Lagbe - Flat Rental (To-Let) Website

A full-stack rental platform where users can search, see provided images, filter out and get contact info with location on map , while admins and super admins manage listings and users.  
This project was built to practice **real-world problem solving** and demonstrate my full-stack development skills.
